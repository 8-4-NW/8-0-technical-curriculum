## Guiding Questions

- What is a method?

- Documentation can sometimes be difficult to read, but is essential to your success as a developer. Take a look at the following page from the Mozilla Developer Network that describes the `.push()` method. Then, describe in your own words what the `.push()` method does.

  - [MDN: .push()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)

- In your repl, come up with a code example that demonstrates how `.push()` works. Think of an example that would help you describe `.push()` to another classmate.

- Using bracket notation, you can perform the same effect as `.push()`. What is the benefit to using `.push()`, if any? What are the differences between the two options?

### Group activity

In groups, you will be assigned one or more methods or tools. With your group, look at the documentation and come up with a few code samples.

Once your group has had time to do its research, you will be split into different groups where you will present what you learned to your classmates. Be prepared to answer questions to best of your ability about what you've learned.

If there are any lingering questions, write them down so that you can ask your instructor.
