# Colin's Computer Setup Notes

Hello! These are some additional notes and tips from Colin for setting up a macOS web development environment.

## The Future Of This Document

This may end up being a full-fledged setup document at some point, but for now, please treat it as a supplement to the main `readme.md` file.

Many headings will have "Under Construction!!" messages. These are sections I hope to cover at some point.

## Alternate Way To Install Visual Studio Code If Your `code` Command Stops Working.

This alternative way to install VS Code _always_ installs the `code` command automatically.

It's also easier to install and uninstall things this way.

### Pre-requisites

- Homebrew

### Setup

In your terminal, enter:

```sh
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Bam. You now have both Visual Studio Code and the `code` terminal command in one step.

### Uninstalling

Should you ever want to uninstall Code (perhaps to install it another way, or you just decide you want to use a weird editor), you'll go to your terminal and enter:

```sh
brew uninstall visual-studio-code
```
