## Setup

Please complete the following before the lesson begins:

- Open and then fork this [repl](https://replit.com/@Pursuit/Warmup-Data-Representation-with-Code#index.js).
- Complete the Warmup Questions & Tasks detailed at the top of the repl.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Represent object properties in the real world as code.

---

## Guiding Questions

- What are the JavaScript data types you've used so far?

- Objects have properties. What kind of properties might a country have? What data type would you use to represent those properties?

- Imagine you're building an application that helps you find great deals on flights. What kinds of objects might appear in your application?

- You'll be assigned one of the potential applications from the list below. Come up with at least three different objects that you imagine would be in that application. Also come up with at least three properties for each object.

  Consider what kind of information you need for each object as well as what data type it could be stored as.

  | Industry  | Application description                                                 |
  | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Travel    | A hotel cost comparison application.                                    |
  | Fitness   | A gym rating tracker application.                                       |
  | Music     | An application that takes a song and builds a playlist around it.       |
  | Food      | A recipe recommender.                                                   |
  | Gaming    | A blog that reviews games for all ages.                                 |
  | Books     | An application that helps you find a book club based on your interests. |
  | Fashion   | A store that sells clothing from independent designers.                 |
  | Education | An application that connects you with free classes in your city.        |

## Exercise

Read the brief below that describes a kind of object. Then, mockup three examples of that kind of object.

Once your done, check in with your instructor.

> Represent the concept of a **company** in code. Each company should have a name, headquarters full address, what year it was founded, the number of employees, its industry, whether or not it is a non-profit, and who its current CEO is. For the CEO, include the CEO's name.
