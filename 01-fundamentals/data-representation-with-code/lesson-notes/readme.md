## Guiding Questions

- What are the JavaScript data types you've used so far?

- Objects have properties. What kind of properties might a country have? What data type would you use to represent those properties?

- Imagine you're building an application that helps you find great deals on flights. What kinds of objects might appear in your application?

- You'll be assigned one of the potential applications from the list below. Come up with at least three different objects that you imagine would be in that application. Also come up with at least three properties for each object.

  Consider what kind of information you need for each object as well as what data type it could be stored as.
