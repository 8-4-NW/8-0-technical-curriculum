# Introduction to Algorithms

## Setup

Please complete the following before the lesson begins:

- Clear your screen of any distractions. You should only have Slack, Zoom, and your browser open.
- Make sure your microphone is functioning, but muted, and that your camera is on.
- Recall how to display an emoji on your screen. Once you've done so, share your favorite emoji with the class.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Define the term algorithm.
- Write algorithms in plain English to solve for everyday problems.

---

- What is an algorithm? Define it in your own words.

- Many algorithms require an input. What does the term "input" mean in this context?

- What are some examples of algorithms that you perform on a regular basis?

- What does the "happy path" refer to when talking about algorithms?

- What is an edge case?

- Imagine you've taken a photo with your phone that you want to have printed out, so that you have a physical copy. What algorithm could be used to accomplish this process? Define the input, output, and set of steps you'd need to follow, assuming the "happy path."

  There are many ways to solve this problem, so feel free to be creative.

- Are there any edge cases to the algorithm you came up with? How can you account for one or two of them?

## Exercise

In plain language, write the algorithm for a simple binary search. Binary search is a common algorithm that is used to search through a list of ordered items for a particular item. Keep in mind that you do not need to write any code at all to complete this exercise.

### Resources

Binary search is explained in [this video](https://youtu.be/e_WfC8HwVB8?t=55), starting at around 55 seconds. If you'd like a less wordy and more visual explanation, you may enjoy [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP897Z5Nerk), which demonstrates binary search through dance.

Define what the required input is and what the required output is. Then, consider a list of items that is an odd number. For example, searching through a list of 19 names.

Once you have a complete algorithm, consider what needs to change about your algorithm, if anything, if the size of the list is an even number.

Once you are complete, speak with an instructor who can check your answer.
