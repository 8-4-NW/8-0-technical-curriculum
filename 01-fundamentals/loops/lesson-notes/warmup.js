  Warmup Questions & Tasks
  ------------------------
  Answer the following questions and/or complete the tasks.

  - The `complexArray` variable below stores a multidimensional array. Based on what you see, what do you think it means for an array to be "multidimensional?"
  - Access a `0` somewhere in the array. Then, log out that value.
  - Access a `1` somewhere in the array. Then, log out that value.
  - Add up all of the `1`s in the array by using bracket notation. For example:
    ```
    complexArray[0][2] + complexArray[1][2] ...
    ```
*/

const complexArray = [
  [0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 0],
];
